input files are named according to their contents:

the first letter: c, m, and s correspond to the cube being in a checkered, mixed, or solved state

I chose to include a checkered state because it causes the most ambiguity in differentiating colors.

the second component is either the number of sides shown, or vid for videos

in the case of pictures, the colors will the be listed by first letter
